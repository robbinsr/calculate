You are reading the README.md file in the calculate GitHub repository for Russ Robbins. This is a project that is a work in progress. The purpose of this repository is to provide some insight into how I am using or can use Python, in the context of a lightly complex problem. However, the package is far from complete. When/if completed this will be the backend for an interactive binary classification confusion matrix that will allow you to enter three of any of the four joint probabilities or the eight conditional probabilities and in return receive all the other probability values back, as well as the ratios such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, etc. The current design relies on 36 probability equations, a dictionary that stores probabilities, a dictionary that dispatches functions, and an ArgumentParser which handles command line arguments.
